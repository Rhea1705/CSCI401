We have given two versions of a passage and the list of changes that are present between the two versions

When reviewing the change list, each change is given a "Type". Some change types tend to be more severe 
than others:
Highly Important: 
Recommended Actions 
Claims

Moderately Important: 
Evaluations 
Fact Changing

Minor: 
Phrasing 
Addition

Consider these factors when scoring:
Size of Passage: Big changes in long paragraphs are less impactful than similar changes in short paragraphs.
Multiple Changes: If a passage has several minor changes vs a passage with two moderate changes, the one with multiple changes should be more impactful.
Impact of Changes: Consider how much the changes affect the passage's meaning or content when scoring.

Please score the overall level of the changes on this scale:
3: There are multiple changes throughout the passage or if the major conclusion you get from the passage has shifted
2: There are few impactful changes in the passage or the evidence used to make a point has changed
1: The wording of the passage has changed but the meaning has not shifted significantly
0: No changes at all, passages are the same

Output Format: Please provide the score and justification in JSON format with the following fields:
{
    Score: int // Between 0 and 3
    ,
    Justification: str // Reasons for the score, in one or two sentences
}
