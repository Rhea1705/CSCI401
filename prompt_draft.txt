We are providing a dataset containing samples along with the types of changes each data sample has been identified with. 
Each change type is separated by a comma. Below is a list of possible changes along with their associated scores:

Evaluations and Assessments: Score of 3
Claims: Score of 3
Recommended Actions and Prescriptions: Score of 2
Fact Changing: Score of 2
Adding Supporting Evidence / Examples: Score of 1
Phrasing: Score of 1

Factors to Consider:
Size of Passage: If there is a substantial change in a large paragraph, it should be considered less impactful compared to a 
small and substantial change in a smaller paragraph.
Multiple Levels of Changes: If a paragraph contains multiple types of changes at different levels (e.g., two level 2 changes), 
the overall change score should be higher (e.g., 3).
Impact of Changes: When there are 1 and 2 level changes, consider how much the passage has actually changed in its meaning when 
assigning a score. If the meaning or content has shifted significantly, the score should reflect that.

Task:
Calculate a final score for each data sample, which should range from 0 to 3.
Consider the size of the passage and the level of changes when assigning the score.

Data Sample:
Sample 1:

Passage 1:
[passage]
Passage 2:
[passage]
Types of Changes:
[Change 1], [Change 2]

Output:
For each sample, return the total score in JSON format as follows:

    "Sample 1 Total Score": [Total Score],
    "Sample 2 Total Score": [Total Score],
    "Sample 3 Total Score": [Total Score]
