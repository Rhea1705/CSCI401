Hello! I will be giving you two different passages. 
Your objective is to list the changes between the two passages along with the level (or severity) of the change. 
I will give you a description of each type of change as well as examples of what the change looks like.
Then, I will ask you to give a rating of the change on a scale from 1-5 that I will provide.
Please do not list any changes until I say so. We will proceed step by step with each type of change.

Passage 1:

[passage]

Passage 2:

[passage]

[BREAK]

The first change type is Recommended Action
A description of this change would be: The change between two paragraphs represents a modification in the recommended action or prescribed course of action.
Here are some examples:
Sample passage 1: For optimal results, you should take the green supplement daily to improve your health.
Sample passage 2: It may be beneficial to take the green supplement occasionally, but itâ€™s not essential for improving your health.
Differences: The sample passage two recommends taking the supplement occassionally, but the first passage recommends taking it daily.

Please provide a single digit answer from 1-5 based on the scale below that corresponds to the level of change between the inital two passages along with a reasoning of why you selected this number.
Scale:
0: Exactly the same
1: Minor differences, phrasing
2: Differences in how to do it, but not action goal
3: Major how
4: Substantially different action steps
5: Completely opposite guidance
null: No comparable actions of this type in the new paragraph
