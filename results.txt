Recommended Action: 4 - The first passage recommends taking the green supplement daily, while the second passage recommends taking it occasionally. This is a substantial change in the recommended action.
Claim: 4 - The first passage claims that taking the supplement daily will improve your health, while the second passage claims that it may be beneficial to take it occasionally but it's not essential for improving health. This is a substantially different claim.
Evaluation: 4 - The first passage evaluates the effectiveness of the DRL agent in finding and exploiting an arbitrage, while the second passage evaluates the efficiency and Sharpe ratios produced by the agent. This is a substantial change in evaluation criteria.
Fact Changing: 3 - The second passage introduces new evidence of the DRL agent producing better Sharpe ratios, which changes the facts presented in the first passage. However, the fact that the agent is finding and exploiting an arbitrage remains essentially the same.
Phrasing: 2 - There are minor differences in phrasing between the two passages, such as the use of "latest technology" in the second passage compared to "new technology" in the first passage.
Addition: 3 - The second passage adds new information about the DRL agent producing better Sharpe ratios, which changes the evaluation and

Recommended Action: 4 - The recommended actions in the two passages are substantially different. In passage 1, the recommended action is to use DRL technology for financial problems, while in passage 2, the recommended action is to use domain knowledge to encourage the training algorithm for better optima.

Claim: 3 - There is a significant change in the claim being made between the two passages. In passage 1, the main point being made is about using DRL for financial problems, while in passage 2, the main point is about the efficiency and success of DRL in finding and exploiting arbitrage opportunities.

Evaluation: 3 - There is a significant change in the evaluation of the situation between the two passages. In passage 1, the focus is on applying DRL to financial problems, while in passage 2, the emphasis is on the efficiency and success of DRL in finding and exploiting arbitrage opportunities.

Fact Changing: 3 - There is a significant difference in the evidence presented between the two passages. In passage 1, the evidence is focused on using DRL for financial problems, while in passage 2, the evidence is about the efficiency and success of DRL in finding and exploiting arbitrage opportunities.

stable_matching:

Recommended Action: 3
There is a significant change in the recommended action between the two passages. In passage 1, the recommended action is to take into account the dependence structure of observations explicitly, while in passage 2, it is to take into account the dependence structure of observations carefully. This shift in language suggests a significant difference in the approach to developing inference for large matching markets.

Claim: 3
There is a significant change in the claim between the two passages. In passage 1, the main point is that their result can potentially be useful for developing inference on large matching markets, while in passage 2, the main point is that their result can be useful for developing inference that does not require random sampling. These are two distinct claims that focus on different aspects of the research.

Evaluation: 2
There are differences in tone or degree of evaluation between the two passages. In passage 1, there is a belief that their result can potentially be useful, while in passage 2, there is a statement that their result can be useful. This suggests a slight shift in the level of confidence in the usefulness of their research.

Fact Changing: 1
There are minor differences in the fact presented between the two passages. In passage 1, it

        Score: 1,
        Justification: The change in recommended action is minor, as both passages still recommend using Adam for efficient stochastic optimization.
        Citation: "We propose Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization that only requires first-order gradients and requires little memory." (Passage 1) vs "We propose Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization that only requires first-order gradients with little memory requirement." (Passage 2)

    Claim: 
        Score: 1,
        Justification: The main point in both passages is that Adam is an efficient stochastic optimization method, with minor differences in wording.
        Citation: "We demonstrate that Adam works well in practice when experimentally compared to other stochastic optimization methods." (Passage 1) vs "Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods." (Passage 2)

Recommended_Action:
Score: 4, 
Justification: The recommended action in the first passage is to use the Poncelet method consistently for optimal results, while the recommended action in the second passage is to use the Poncelet method only for chronological sequences. This is a substantial difference in action steps. 
Citation: "Of all reduction methods examined, Poncelet consistently performed best, but its advantage lacks a fundamental explanation and could be a coincidental result limited to the considered example." - Passage 1

Claim:
Score: 3,
Justification: The main point of the first passage is that TSR should be used with caution when modeling renewable energy systems, while the main point of the second passage is that there is no generally advantageous method for creating reduced time-series. This is a significant change in the claim or evidence presented.
Citation: "The results show that TSR should be applied with great caution when modelling renewable energy systems." - Passage 1

Evaluation:
Score: 3,
Justification: In the first passage, the evaluation is that implementing reduced time-series as time-slices is not advised. In the second passage, the evaluation is that implementation of reduced time-series as grouped periods did not consistently achieve small shares of lost load. This
