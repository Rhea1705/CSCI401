Hello! I will be giving you two different passages. 
Your objective is to list the changes between the two passages along with the level (or severity) of the change. 
I will give you a description of each type of change as well as examples of what the change looks like.
Then, I will ask you to give a rating of the change on a scale from 1-5 that I will provide.

Passage 1:

[passage]

Passage 2:

[passage]

The first change type is "Recommended Action"
A description of this change would be: The change between two paragraphs represents a modification in the recommended action or prescribed course of action.
Here are some examples:
Sample passage 1: For optimal results, you should take the green supplement daily to improve your health.
Sample passage 2: It may be beneficial to take the green supplement occasionally, but itâ€™s not essential for improving your health.
Differences: The sample passage two recommends taking the supplement occassionally, but the first passage recommends taking it daily.

2: Reference material for the fact is different, but the fact remains essentially the same
3: Reference material for the fact is different, and there is a minor difference

0: Nothing new was added
1: A word was added but it does not change the meaning of the sentence
2: A sentence was added but it does not change the meaning of the text
3: The addition creates another change in either phrasing or evidence
4: The addition creates another change in evaluation
5: The addition creates another change in either claim or recommended actions
null: The texts are not comparable to determine if a new addition exists

Your job is to give me six individual scores of changes based on each of the change types in json format as listed below. Please provide a single digit score for each along with a justification of why you chose that score, citing the change you found in the text.

NOTES: list of changes first and then assign each change to a category

** maybe give llm more freedom 
** simpler changs 
** definition of phrasing (synonyms)
** paraphrasing .. trained to pick up paraphrases?
** "train-test split" i.e. 40-10
** policy docs
** conclusions on academic papers
