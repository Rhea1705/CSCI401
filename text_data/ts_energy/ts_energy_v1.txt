The results show that TSR should be applied with caution when modeling renewable energy systems. Besides
intermittency of renewables, dependency on seasonal storage adversely affects the accuracy of TSR. As suggested by
former research, we found the accuracy of TSR to increase with the length of the reduced time-series.
Implementation of reduced time-series as grouped periods did not consistently achieve small shares of lost load.
Furthermore, no generally advantageous method for creating reduced time-series nor any fundamental bias on installed
capacities was identified. Compared to chronological sequences, grouped periods required more time so solve for the
same number of time-steps, presumably due to variables and constraints added to implement seasonal storage.
For implementation as chronological sequences, results highly depend on how reduced time-series are adjusted to
achieve consistency with the full time-series. If the reduced time-series is not re-scaled, results show a bias towards
short-term storage and considerable loss of load. If the reduced time-series is re-scaled on the other hand, results are
instead biased towards long-term storage overestimating system costs but achieving small shares of lost load. These
results are likely to differ for regions with less pronounced seasonal and greater short-term fluctuations. Regarding the
derivation of reduced time-series, the Poncelet method performed favorable with chronological sequences.
