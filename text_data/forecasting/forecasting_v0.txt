A limitation of our approach is that it is designed for accommodating only seasonal
data. Moreover, our approach just focuses on simple seasonal patterns. While for the
time series that exhibit complex multiple seasonal patterns (e.g., multiple seasonal periods
can be observed in the electric load data shown in Figure 8), how to effectively use such
complex multiple sub-seasonal patterns to improve forecasting remains to be studied
in the future (De Livera et al., 2011). On the other hand, in this work, we simply
set equal weights for multiple forecasts and potential research such as calculating their
optimal unequal combination weights could be explored in the future to further improve
forecasting performance.
