In this paper, we focused our attention on creating sub-seasonal series using adjacent
periods from the original seasonal series. An alternative would be to consider even more
sub-seasonal series that are not necessarily limited to ones with adjacent periods, thus
creating a larger pool of series and their accompanying forecasts. Averaging across such
series could help us further reduce the variance of the forecasts even, possibly with a
positive effect on the forecasting performance. Moreover, in this work, we set equal
weights for combining the forecasts from the various sub-seasonal series. A potential
avenue for future research would be investigating the performance of optimal (unequal)
combination weights.
