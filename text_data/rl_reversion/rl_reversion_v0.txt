The main contribution of this paper is that we show how to apply DRL
to quantitative financial problems and how to incorporate domain knowledge to assist the
training for finding a better optimal. We provide a proof of concept in a controlled numerical
simulation which permits an approximate arbitrage, and we verify that the DRL agent finds
and exploits this arbitrage.
Again, note that although we only evaluated our results on two specific price processes
and used a specific cost model, the DRL agent did not know that there was mean reversion
in asset prices, nor did it know anything about the cost of trading. Therefore it could indeed
learn other price and cost models with little extra tuning. You can find more code samples
and other function properties being explored in the github repository.
