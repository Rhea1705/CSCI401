This article demonstrates how to apply DRL to quantitative nancial problems
using the latest technology developed by the pioneers in the eld, and how to use domain knowledge
to encourage the underlying training algorithm for nding better local optima. I provide a proof of
concept in a controlled numerical simulation which permits an approximate arbitrage, and I verify
that the DRL agent nds and exploits this arbitrage in a highly ecient way, while producing Sharpe
ratios that surpass prior state-of-the-arts.
