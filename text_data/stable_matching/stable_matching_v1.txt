This paper considers a large two-sided matching market, where a matching between the
two sides is stable. In such a situation, it is a non-trivial matter to establish limit theorems
for statistics such as empirical matching probabilities as the number of market participants
grows. Using the re-equilibration arguments from economic theory, we derive a concentration
inequality for various statistics that involve matching outcomes in this environment.
In order to develop inference that does not require random sampling from a large matching, one needs to take into account the dependence structure of the observations carefully.
However, this is challenging in large matching markets. It is left to future research to establish
limit distribution theory for the large matching setting, where a complex dependence structure
arises naturally due to the interdependence among agents in the underlying market.
