This paper considers a large two-sided matching market, where a matching between the two sides is realized through a centralized algorithm such as a DA mechanism. In such a situation, it is a nontrivial matter to establish limit theorems for
statistics including matching frequencies as the number of the participants grows.
Using the re-equilibration arguments from economic theory and a concentration inequality, we derive a concentration inequality for matching frequencies in this
environment.
We believe that our result can potentially be useful for developing inference on
large matching markets under a wide range of sampling processes. To develop
inference robust to sampling processes (such as random sampling), one needs to
take into account the dependence structure of the observations explicitly. As mentioned before, this is challenging in large matching markets. Our work addresses
this challenge and reveals the role of partial homogeneity of preferences in the
concentration-of-measure phenomenon for matching frequencies. It is left to future
research to establish limit distribution theory for the large matching setting, where
a complex dependence structure arises naturally due to the strategic interdependence in the underlying market.
