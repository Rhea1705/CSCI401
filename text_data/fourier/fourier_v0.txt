In this paper, we define a spectrum of gene interactions that permit the analysis of effects
as a sum of contributions from all possible sets of gene loci. The exponential expansion of
combinations leads to the scale problem. We show that compressive sensing offers a path toward
addressing the scale problem of describing the effects of genes on quantitative traits.
There is a class of traits whose smoothness allows a precise description based upon a much
smaller number of observations, rather than the 2n
that would be theoretically be required. This
occurs in traits composed from more-or-less independent modules. Such modular structures
greatly generalize previous attempts to reconstruct a trait from independent allele effects. For
this class of traits (and possibly others), the Fourier transform provides a natural “compression”
of the data in the gene network. The uncertainty principle for the discrete group Z
n

ensures that,
since the gene network space is sufficiently concentrated, the effects in trait space are pervasive,
so that a limited number of randomly chosen organisms will provide useful data. In effect, the
“needles in the haystack” of the gene network cannot hide because they will poke all of the
genomes. Much work still remains to find traits with the requisite smoothness. This may involve
recasting biological traits by a monotone transformation.
