In this paper, we define a spectrum of gene interactions that permit the analysis of quantitative
traits as a sum of contributions from all possible sets of gene loci. The exponential expansion
of combinations leads to the scale problem. We explore heuristic arguments that many traits
may permit the application of compressive sensing to describe traits in terms of a low-level
concentrated set of gene network interactions.
The uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform ensures that, whenever the gene network
of a trait is sufficiently concentrated, the effects in trait space are pervasive, so that a limited
number of randomly chosen organisms will provide useful data. In effect, the “needles in the
haystack” of the gene network cannot hide because they will poke all of the genomes. Much
work still remains to test this theory empirically. This may involve recasting biological traits
by a monotone transformation. But Poelwijk’s proteomics example [40] shows the viability of
this approach. The time may be ripe for further application of this technique. For instance, various amino acid substitutions either in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or in the ACE2 receptor
may affect their mutual binding strength [69–71] (taking binding strength as the relevant trait).
Conveniently, the analysis need not be confined to just one protein: the amino acid substitutions can occur in both the spike protein and receptor. This application of Fourier techniques to
proteomics might permit a rapid prediction of the features of a novel spike mutation spreading
through genetically diverse populations.
