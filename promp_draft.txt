We are providing a dataset containing samples along with the types of changes each data sample 
has been identified with. Each change type is separated by a comma. 
Below is a list of possible changes along with their associated scores.

Please replace each type of change with its corresponding score based on the following scoring criteria:

Evaluations and Assessments: Score of 6
Claims: Score of 5
Recommended Actions and Prescriptions: Score of 4
Fact Changing: Score of 3
Adding Supporting Evidence / Examples: Score of 2
Phrasing: Score of 1

Once you have converted the types of changes into scores, compile a list of scores for each data sample, 
separated by commas. For each data sample, calculate the maximum score and assign it as the total score.

Data Sample:

Sample 1: [Type of Change 1, Type of Change 2]
Sample 2: [Type of Change, ...]
Sample 3: [Type of Change, ...]

Output:
For each sample, return the total score in JSON format as follows:
{
    "Sample 1 Total Score": [Total Score],
    "Sample 2 Total Score": [Total Score],
    "Sample 3 Total Score": [Total Score]
}
